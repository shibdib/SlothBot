# Sloth Bot

Artificial Intelligence for the programming game Screeps.

This code is designed to function fine with no user interaction. It also uses flags to allow the user to guide it if
they desire.

For discussion or support message **Shibdib** on Discord.

_This was made as a way for me to learn JS, so excuse any horrible practices you may encounter. Slowly refactoring the
really ugly stuff._
