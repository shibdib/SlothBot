/**
 * This Log class acts as a simple logging mechanism, taking advantage of how
 * the Screeps logger outputs to raw HTML. It preserves a logging level in
 * memory to keep track of what to output and what to ignore. This only needs
 * to store a single integer in memory, should be acceptable. This could also
 * be modified to trigger other events such as an automatic defense response if
 * an ALERT level logging event occurs.
